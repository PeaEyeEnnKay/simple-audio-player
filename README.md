# simple-audio-player
A quickly hacked together simple audio player example using PHP, javascript, and HTML5 audio tag.

To use: 
1. Create a folder called "audio" wherever you've put the index.php file. 
2. Add MP3 or WAV files to the "audio" folder.

The two pages:
- index.php is the basic simple audio player. It's a simple version with no bells and whistles so that it's a simple example of the basics involved.

- styledplayer.php that does the same basic things but has additional styling and some added features to make it more usable in a day to day context.
